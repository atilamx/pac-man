This code was just an exercise for me just to keep my coding skill up to date. The game runs smoothly and it is engaging unfortunately for now it does not work in mobile; I need to make some adjustments for that and I used only Chrome so it does not work outside that browser at all.

Docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/manologutierrez/nginx-pacman

Demo: http://pac-man.michelada.io

Im Planning to use the game to train a Neural Network that im working with.

Run the code through nginx as a web server, otherwise it will not work the reason is that the game does some ajax calls. Hope you like it :)

Nginx example.
```
server {
	listen 80 default_server;
	listen [::]:80 default_server;

	root /var/www/html;

	index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

	server_name pac-man.michelada.io;

	location / {
		# First attempt to serve request as file, then
		# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	}

}
